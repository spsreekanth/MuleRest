In addition to the features listed in the previous answers, a workflow orchestration tool that supports sequential, parallel, and conditional workflows should also have the following features:

Flow Control: The ability to define and control the flow of a workflow, including the ability to specify sequential and parallel branches, and to make decisions based on conditions.

Looping: The ability to repeat a particular step or set of steps in a workflow, allowing for the execution of repetitive tasks.

Parallel Execution: The ability to execute multiple steps or services in parallel, in order to speed up the overall execution of a workflow.

Conditional Execution: The ability to execute different steps or services based on the outcome of a particular condition, allowing for dynamic and adaptive workflows.

Error Handling: The ability to handle errors that may occur during the execution of a workflow, and to take appropriate action to recover from them.

Sub-Workflow: The ability to call other workflows or sub-workflows as steps in the main workflow, allowing for the composition of complex workflows from simpler ones.

Versioning: The ability to version workflows and rollback to previous versions, in order to handle changes and updates.

Visualization: The ability to visualize the workflow, including its current state, the progress of each step, and the dependencies between different steps, in order to understand and debug the workflow.
